  questionText: In the adjacency matrix for an undirected graph, if A is adjacent
    to B, is B also adjacent to A?
  answers:
  - Yes, because the matrix is symmetrical (A,B=1 and B,A=1)
  - No, only A is adjacent to B.
  - Only if the graph is a weighted graph.
  - Yes, but only in directed graphs.
