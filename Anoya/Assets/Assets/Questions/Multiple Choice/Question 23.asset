  questionText: What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
  answers:
  - A compiler translates one program statement at a time, while an interpreter translates
    the entire program at once.
  - A compiler translates a program written in a high-level language into a low-level
    language before executing it, while an interpreter translates one program statement
    at a time and executes it as soon as it is translated.
  - ' A compiler checks for logical errors, while an interpreter checks for syntax
    errors.'
  - A compiler is used for low-level languages, while an interpreter is used for
    high-level languages.
